                <h2>Brazilian Horned Frog</h2>

                    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_horned_frog">Brazilian horned frog</a> has a mouth as huge as the ornate horned frog and a reputation for being just as aggressive, if not more so.
                     Blending into the leaf litter on the forest floor, the 8-inch long frog only has its (huge) head visible, ready to snatch any potential prey that wanders past. Some specimens have been
                    found dead with prey sticking out of their mouths, having suffocated rather than give up a large meal.
                    It will go after practically anything, including intruders, and that includes the feet of people walking past. So the word of advice around this frog is don't tread too near one!</p>

                <h2>Golden Poison Dart Frog</h2>
                <p> <img src="https://www.treehugger.com/thmb/gi5caQ-TJyJZXmlUkwKR6MGEqOc=/990x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__mnn__images__2015__04__golden-dart-frog-93a2f7847a474d758619bedbe97653a0.jpg" height="200" width="200" style="float:right">
                    The scientific name for this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_poison_frog">species </a> is Phyllobates terribilis, and for good reason. As one of the most toxic animals on the planet, a single 2-inch frog has enough toxin to kill between 10-20 adult humans, or two bull elephants.
                    Just one gram of the toxin produced by the skin of the the golden dart frog could kill 15,000 people.
                    Just how the tiny frogs manage to be so toxic is still a mystery to researchers, but it's believed they get it from the poisonous plants eaten by their prey of insects, beetles, ants and termites. Frogs raised in captivity never become toxic; only the wild frogs are lethal. Their skin is coated in alkaloid toxin, which can persist for a long time after the frogs have been separated from their usual food sources.
                    As for being food itself, the frog kills everything that tries to eat it, except for the snake species Liophis epinephelus. This is the only species known to have a resistance to (but not immunity from) the toxin of the golden dart frog.</p>

                <h2>Ornate Horned Frog</h2>
                <p> <img src="https://www.treehugger.com/thmb/ij2r1WvVuW10DFo6BONwaP6AiMo=/990x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__mnn__images__2015__04__ornate-horned-frog-390e6ca4eac845648bd79b68a0be605a.jpg" height="200" width="200" style="float:right">
                    While some frogs choose to hide, others choose to stand out. Such is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_horned_frog">horned frog</a>, also known as the Argentine horned frog, Argentine wide-mouthed frog, and ornate Pacman frog.
                    Why "Pacman" frog? Because this frog will try to swallow pretty much anything that gets close to its unusually large mouth. The frog's menu includes everything from insects to rodents to other frogs. It has an insatiable appetite packaged in a 6-inch body that is half mouth â€” literally. Its mouth accounts for around half of the frog's body. As the National Zoo puts it,
                    "These frogs are sometimes called 'mouths with legs' because the mouth appears to be the entire front half of the body."
                    Wide-mouthed indeed! Their bite is, as you might expect, powerful. You don't want to get your fingers anywhere near these guys!
